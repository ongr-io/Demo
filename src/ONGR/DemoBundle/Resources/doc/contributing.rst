You can contribute to ONGR by forking the repository, then making changes and sending a pull request (PR) to the master branch.

Code must adhere to project's `Coding Standards </src/ONGR/DemoBundle/Resources/doc/coding_standards.rst>`_.

ONGR follows `TDD <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_ methodology, so code will be accepted faster, if the respective tests are provided with the PR.
