===========
Quick start
===========

Let's get started. We'll guide you step by step through installing and running ONGR the first time. The first installation should not need more than 1 hour.

Step 1: Requirements.
---------------------

Yes there are a few.

Please check if your development environment does meet the following `requirements </src/ONGR/DemoBundle/Resources/doc/requirements.rst>`_.

Step 2: Download ONGR
---------------------

Download the latest release here `archive <https://github.com/ongr-io/ongr-sandbox/releases>`_ and unpack it somewhere under your project directory. Make sure that we have the "Vagrantfile" in the your project root folder.

Step 3: Install Virtual Box
---------------------------

Either install or upgrade `virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_. We need VirtualBox > 4.3

Step 4: Install Vagrant
-----------------------

Either install or upgrade `vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_. We need Vagrant >= 1.6.5

(optional) Now we need to install the hosts updater vagrant plugin.

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

..

   It will help to automatically update /etc/hosts file via adding your new ongr.dev host with correct IP.

And finally - ONLY_FOR_LINUX you need to install the nfs server:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

..

Step 5: Start virtual machine using Vagrant
-------------------------------------------

Let's rock. Move into your project root folder and execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant up

..

(In case you have also something like VMWare installed on your local machine, it is a good idea to give the provider when upping your box:

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

..

)

That's it. The ONGR is alive.

If you experience any problems (e.g. vagrant tends to change the rules with each update and we might lag a bit) please do not hesitate to @@TODO contact us. We'll help.

Now, let's feed the donkey with some data.

Step 6: Install the demo data
-----------------------------

In case to get demo content you need to run the following commands from command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/www
    composer install --no-interaction
    app/console es:index:create
    app/console es:index:import --raw src/ONGR/DemoBundle/Resources/data/data.json

..

   If composer prompts input questions just press enter.

Step 7: Open your browser
